# AI Village Simulation

## Overview

This project is an AI-driven village simulation where users can observe the complex interactions between villagers, their environment, and each other. The simulation aims to create a dynamic, evolving village ecosystem without direct user intervention beyond starting and stopping the simulation.

## Simulation Features

### Villager Behavior
- Villagers have unique goals, desires, skills, and personalities
- They can interact with each other and the environment
- Villagers can form relationships, make friends, and create alliances
- They experience and express emotions, and can empathize with others
- Villagers can learn from experiences and adapt their behavior

### Daily Actions
- Each villager performs one action per day based on their current goals
- After each action, villagers reflect on their choices and plan for the future
- Villagers review and adjust their goals at the end of each day

### Village Dynamics
- Villagers can cooperate to achieve common goals
- Competition for resources and attention occurs naturally
- Information and knowledge are shared through communication
- The village environment can change based on villager actions

### Simulation Mechanics
- The simulation advances one day at a time when the user presses Enter
- All changes to the village are made through AI-controlled function calls
- The simulation records all villager actions for later analysis
- The simulation ends when the user presses Backspace instead of Enter

## Technical Implementation

### Project Structure
- `/data/`: Initial simulation data (e.g., villager information)
- `/models/`: Classes for villagers, buildings, and other entities
- `/simulation/`: Core simulation logic and mechanics
- `/utils/`: Utility functions for AI generation and data manipulation
- `/main.py`: Entry point for running the simulation
- `/README.md`: This file, containing project documentation
- `/.env`: Project dependencies and environment variables

### Design Principles
1. Modular and extensible architecture
2. Well-documented and readable code
3. Efficient performance and resource usage
4. Easy to modify and expand upon
5. Thorough testing to ensure reliability

### Development Guidelines
- Use of appropriate libraries and tools is encouraged
- Implement using object-oriented programming principles
- Utilize design patterns and architectural approaches as needed
- Choose suitable data structures and algorithms for optimal performance

## Customizing the Simulation

### Modifying Villagers
To customize the initial villagers, edit the `data/people.json` file. Each villager object can have the following properties:
- `name`: The villager's name
- `age`: The villager's age
- `occupation`: The villager's occupation
- `backstory` (optional): A brief backstory for the villager
- `personality`: Traits that influence behavior
- `skills`: Abilities that affect task performance
- `relationships`: Initial connections with other villagers

### Adding New Features
1. Implement new classes or functions in the appropriate directories
2. Update existing code to integrate new features
3. Add any necessary data files to the `/data/` directory
4. Document new features or changes in this README file

## Running the Simulation

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (see `.env` file)
2. Run `python main.py` from the project root directory
3. Press Enter to advance the simulation by one day
4. Press Backspace to end the simulation

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a graphical user interface for better visualization
- Add more complex decision-making algorithms for villagers
- Introduce random events to add unpredictability to the simulation
- Develop an economy system with resource management
- Create a system for villager reproduction and population growth

## Contributing

Contributions to improve and expand the simulation are welcome. Please follow the existing code style and add appropriate documentation for any new features or changes.
